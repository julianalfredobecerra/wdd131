            <h2>Ether 12: 27</h2>
            <p>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be
                humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble
                themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</p>

            <h2>Mosiah 2: 41</h2>
            <p>And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep
                the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if
                they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in
                a state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God
                hath spoken it.</p>
